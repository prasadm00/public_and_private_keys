## Public and Private key

RSA works by generating a public and a private key. The public and private keys are generated together and form a key pair.

The public key can be used to encrypt any arbitrary piece of data, but cannot decrypt it.

The private key can be used to decrypt any piece of data that was encrypted by itâ€™s corresponding public key.
